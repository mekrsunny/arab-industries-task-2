# Image Slider with Parallax Effect

This project is a dynamic image slider with a captivating parallax scrolling effect. The goal was to create an engaging UI element that allows users to navigate through a collection of images effortlessly.

## Key Features

1. **Image Slider Powered by Data**:
   - We've implemented a robust image slider that is powered by mock data. Each slide includes an image, title, and subtitle.
   - Users can easily navigate through the images using navigation arrows or dots.

2. **Parallax Effect**:
   - One of the standout features of this slider is the parallax scrolling effect. It provides a sense of depth and immersion as users interact with the slider.
   - Images move at different speeds relative to the user's scrolling, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience.

3. **Smooth Transitions**:
   - We've prioritized smooth and visually appealing transitions between images as users navigate through the slider.
   - Transitions are seamless and enhance the overall user experience.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices.
   - Whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, users can enjoy the slider's functionality and parallax effect.

5. **Custom Styles**:
   - We've applied custom CSS styles to elevate the overall look and feel of the image slider.
   - These styles enhance the parallax effect and make the component visually appealing.

6. **Code Reusability**:
   - Our approach prioritizes code reusability, allowing for easy integration into different projects.
   - The image slider component is designed to be versatile and adaptable.
